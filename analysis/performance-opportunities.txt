ðŸŽ¯ Performance Optimization Opportunities:

ðŸ“¦ Large JavaScript files (>100KB) - Consider code splitting:
  - dist/assets/framer-DGOvHckZ.js (120K)
  - dist/assets/index-BELFTWZQ.js (268K)

ðŸ”„ Potential lazy loading improvements:
  - Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
  - Use React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
  - Lazy load third-party libraries
