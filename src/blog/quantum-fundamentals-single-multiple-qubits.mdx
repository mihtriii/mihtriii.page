## 🔢 Complex Numbers: The Foundation of Quantum Computing

### Why Must It Be Complex Numbers?

One of the first questions in quantum computing is: **Why do we need complex numbers?** The answer lies in the wave-like nature of quantum systems.

#### The Qubit State & The Necessity of Complex Numbers

> **Premise**: Quantum states have wave-like properties. As established, quantum systems behave like waves. A key property of any wave is its **phase**. Therefore, our mathematical description of a quantum state must be able to account for this phase.

The most general way to write the state of a single qubit, $|\psi\rangle$, is:

$$|\psi\rangle = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|1\rangle$$

Where:

- The real parts control the **probability balance** between $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$
- The term $e^{i\phi}$ is the crucial **relative phase factor**

#### Why Complex Numbers are Essential

The phase factor is defined by Euler's formula, which is inherently complex:

$$e^{i\phi} = \cos(\phi) + i \sin(\phi)$$

**Conclusion**: To fully describe a qubit's state, we must include its relative phase ($e^{i\phi}$). Since this phase factor is fundamentally a complex number (containing $i$), the entire framework for describing quantum states **must use complex numbers**.

## 🌌 Hilbert Space of Multi-Qubit Systems

### Combining Hilbert Spaces: The Tensor Product

How do we mathematically describe a two-qubit system? We combine their spaces using the **tensor product** (⊗).

#### Rule: Forming the New Basis

The basis for the combined system is formed by the tensor product of **every** basis vector from each individual space.

- Qubit A basis: $\{|0\rangle_A, |1\rangle_A\}$
- Qubit B basis: $\{|0\rangle_B, |1\rangle_B\}$

The new 4D basis for the combined system is:

$$\{|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle, |11\rangle\}$$

#### Tensor Product: Vector Representation

The tensor product of column vectors is the **Kronecker product**:

$$|01\rangle = |0\rangle \otimes |1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

This is why the Hilbert space dimensions multiply: $2 \times 2 = 4$.

## ⚡ Core Concepts Revisited

### Superposition: The Fundamental Rule

#### The "Rule of the Game"

The principle of superposition is a direct consequence of the linearity of the Schrödinger equation in Hilbert space.

- **Core Idea**: If a system can be in state $|A\rangle$ and also in state $|B\rangle$, then any linear combination $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|A\rangle + \beta|B\rangle$ is also a valid state.
- **Wave Analogy**: Multiple individual waves adding up to form a single composite wave, allowing for interference.

**For a Qubit**: This is why a qubit's state can be $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$.

### Entanglement: The Essence

#### What is an Entangled State?

An entangled state is a shared state for a multi-part system that **cannot be separated** into individual states for its components.

- **Separable State**: $|01\rangle = |0\rangle \otimes |1\rangle$ (We can describe each qubit individually)
- **Entangled State**: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$ (The state of one qubit is undefined without the other)

#### Entanglement vs. Our Classical Worldview

For centuries, physics was built on two intuitive assumptions:

1. **Realism**: Objects have definite, pre-existing properties, independent of observation.
   _(A hidden coin is already heads or tails; we just don't know which.)_

2. **Locality**: An object is only influenced by its immediate surroundings. No influence can travel faster than light.
   _(Flipping a coin here cannot instantly flip a coin on the Moon.)_

> **The "Spooky" Challenge**: Entanglement seems to violate this. Measuring one particle appears to instantly determine the state of its distant partner.

#### The Verdict: Bell's Theorem

In 1964, John Bell devised a mathematical test. He proved that if local realism were true, the correlations between entangled particles would have a strict limit.

**Experiments have decisively and repeatedly shown that this limit is violated.**

**Conclusion**: The universe does **not** obey Local Realism. We must abandon at least one of our core classical assumptions about reality.

#### Making Sense of It: The Many-Worlds Interpretation

One possible "story" to explain the strangeness of entanglement:

- **Core Idea**: The wave function is real and never collapses. Instead, the universe **branches** for each possible measurement outcome.
- **How it explains entanglement**:
  - When you measure your entangled qubit, the universe splits
  - In one branch, you get 0 and your distant partner also gets 0
  - In another branch, another "you" gets 1 and your partner gets 1
  - The perfect correlation is preserved across corresponding branches
  - The "spooky action" is the branching of reality itself

## 🎛️ Qubit Mathematics & Single-Qubit Gates

### Single-Qubit Gates: Unitary Operations

Gates are $2 \times 2$ unitary matrices acting on qubit state: $|\psi'\rangle = U|\psi\rangle$, with $U^\dagger U = I$.

#### Pauli Gates

**Pauli-X (NOT/bit-flip)**:

$$X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

Flips $|0\rangle$ to $|1\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ to $|0\rangle$.

**Pauli-Z (phase flip)**:

$$Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Leaves $|0\rangle$ unchanged, flips phase of $|1\rangle$ to $-|1\rangle$.

**Pauli-Y (bit + phase flip)**:

$$Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

Combines effects of X and Z.

#### Hadamard (H) Gate

**Superposition Creator**:

$$H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Examples:

- $H|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) = |+\rangle$ (equal probabilities for 0 and 1)
- $H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle) = |-\rangle$

#### Phase Gates

**General Phase Gate ($P_\theta$)**:

$$P_\theta = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\theta} \end{bmatrix}$$

**S Gate**: A specific phase gate where $\theta = \pi/2$

$$S = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{bmatrix}$$

**T Gate**: A specific phase gate where $\theta = \pi/4$

$$T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}$$

### Rotation Gates: Why We Need Them

#### Continuous Control

Unlike Pauli gates (fixed 0/1 flips or 90/180-degree phase shifts), rotation gates allow **continuous control** over the qubit's state. They're essential for fine-tuning quantum states and implementing algorithms that require parameter optimization.

> **Visualization**: All single-qubit rotations can be visualized as rotating the state vector on the **Bloch Sphere**.

#### Rotation Gates: X, Y, and Z Rotations

**Rotation around X-axis ($R_x(\theta)$)**:

$$R_x(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) & -i \sin(\theta/2) \\ -i \sin(\theta/2) & \cos(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$$

**Rotation around Y-axis ($R_y(\theta)$)**:

$$R_y(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) & -\sin(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) & \cos(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$$

**Rotation around Z-axis ($R_z(\theta)$)**:

$$R_z(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-i\theta/2} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\theta/2} \end{bmatrix}$$

### Single-Qubit Calculations: Matrix Multiplication

**Goal**: Apply X, then H on $|0\rangle$, compute via matrices.

**Step 1 (X Gate)**:

$$X|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = |1\rangle$$

**Step 2 (H Gate)**:

$$H|1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} = |-\rangle$$

**Combined Operation**:

$$U = H \cdot X = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$

**Final State**:

$$U|0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = |-\rangle$$

## 🔗 Two-Qubit Systems

### Two-Qubit Systems: State Space

#### Why Multi-Qubits?

- **Single qubit**: 2D Hilbert space ($|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$)
- **Two qubits**: 4D Hilbert space via tensor product, which enables entanglement

#### Tensor Product ($\otimes$): Combines Individual State Spaces

Example: $|0\rangle \otimes |0\rangle = |00\rangle = [1, 0, 0, 0]^T$

#### General State

A superposition of all 4 basis states:

$$|\Psi\rangle = a|00\rangle + b|01\rangle + c|10\rangle + d|11\rangle$$

With normalization: $|a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 + |d|^2 = 1$

### Multi-Qubit Gates

#### Example: Apply H on the First Qubit

To apply a Hadamard gate to the first qubit while leaving the second unchanged (I), we use the tensor product of the gate matrices: $H \otimes I$.

$$H \otimes I = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$

Applying this to the state $|00\rangle$:

$$(H \otimes I)|00\rangle = \frac{|00\rangle + |10\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$$

This creates a superposition between the two qubits.

#### Circuit Operations

- Qubit 0: H → Z
- Qubit 1: X → H → R_X(π/2) → Z
- CNOT between qubits

**Initial**: $|\psi_0\rangle = |00\rangle$

The complete calculation involves:

1. **Step 1**: Apply $H \otimes X$
2. **Step 2**: Apply CNOT gate
3. **Step 3**: Apply $I \otimes H$
4. **Step 4**: Apply $I \otimes R_X(\pi/2)$
5. **Step 5**: Apply $Z \otimes Z$

**Final State**:

$$|\psi_{\text{final}}\rangle = (Z \otimes Z) \cdot (I \otimes R_X(\pi/2)) \cdot (I \otimes H) \cdot \text{CNOT} \cdot (H \otimes X) \cdot |00\rangle$$

The final state is a complex superposition of all four basis states with the form:

$$|\psi_{\text{final}}\rangle = c_0|00\rangle + c_1|01\rangle + c_2|10\rangle + c_3|11\rangle$$

where $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 + |c_2|^2 + |c_3|^2 = 1$.
